 Digital Portfolio for Project Presentation 3
This digital portfolio was created based on the Work Readiness training Module. I completed all the online lessons and quizzes, and this document reflects what I learned in each section
1. Career Counselling

Reflection
S:I completed the Career Development lesson . The lesson talked about how important it is to have a clear plan for your future and what steps you can take to get there.
T:I had to think about what I want from my career, not just what I’m studying now, but what kind of work I see myself doing in the next few years.
A:I thought seriously about my own goals and interests. I wrote down things like gaining more IT project experience, improving my communication skills, and eventually working in a tech company that helps solve real-world problems. I also made sure I understood how to write SMART goals properly.
R:I realised that I’ve never really written down my career goals before. This exercise made me sit down and plan what steps I need to take. It made me more confident about what I want to do after graduating. I now understand that success starts with a clear plan, and I feel motivated to follow that plan.

2.Skills and Interests

Reflection
S:This part made me look deeper into who I am and what matters to me when it comes to work. It made me think about my values and what kind of tasks I actually enjoy doing.
T:I had to reflect on past experiences and figure out what made me feel proud, happy, and fulfilled. Then I had to use that to decide what kind of jobs might match me.
A:I looked back on times when I enjoyed working in groups, solving problems, or helping others understand something. I realised that I value things like creativity, learning new things, and working with a purpose. I also realised I’m happiest when I’m organised and have a clear task to complete.
R:After this lesson, I started seeing how important it is to match your job to your personal values and interests.  I want to be in a role where I’m solving real problems and using both my technical and people skills. This section helped me better understand what I want from a career, not just what I’m good at.

3.Personality Assessment

Reflection
S:The personality assessment section helped me understand how my personality could influence the kind of work I’d enjoy or be good at.
T:I needed to learn about personality types and figure out where I fit, and then think about how that affects my career choices.
A:Based on the lesson and quiz, I discovered that I relate most to the Social and Conventional types. I enjoy structure and order, but I also like working with people, helping others, and supporting a team. I don’t enjoy chaotic environments or roles with no clear direction.
R: This made me realise I’d be more suited for a job like IT support, project coordination, or business analysis — roles where I can be organised, follow a clear structure, but still help people solve problems. This knowledge will help me choose a career that matches both my personality and work style.

S:I had to build a CV that I could use in real life ,not just for this assignment, but for internships and job applications after I graduate.
T:I needed to apply the skills from the lesson to build a well-organised, error-free CV that clearly shows my strengths.
A: I followed the structure: personal info, education, work experience, skills, and references. I edited it carefully to remove spelling and grammar mistakes and saved a version in PDF.
R: I now feel more confident applying for jobs because I have a professional-looking CV. I also learned that a CV isn’t just about listing what you’ve done — it’s about presenting yourself in a way that makes you stand out. I’m going to keep updating it as I gain more experience.

5. CV Submission

Reflection
S:Submitting the CV was a big step because it made the whole process feel real. It wasn’t just about completing lessons, this was me actually preparing for the working world.
T:I had to make sure my CV was complete, correctly formatted, and submitted on time.
A:I reviewed it one last time, checked for errors, and uploaded it. I made sure the file name was clear and professional, and that everything was correct before clicking submit.
R:I felt proud of myself for completing the whole module and submitting a document that represents who I am. This helped me understand the importance of deadlines and professionalism, especially when applying for real jobs in the future.
